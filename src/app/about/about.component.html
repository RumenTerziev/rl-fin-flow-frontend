      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a full-stack developer driven by a passion for building efficient, scalable, and user-focused web
        applications. My journey began with a free online Java course at SoftUni, which sparked my interest in
        software development. Since then, I’ve graduated with a diploma in Software Engineering and gained nearly
        two years of industry experience, working on a wide range of projects that have helped me grow both
        technically and professionally.

  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <p>
    I specialize in Java, Spring Boot, Angular, Python and MySQL, with production deployment experience using
    Microsoft Azure. I also have hands-on experience with Docker, Jenkins, Git, Redis, and Jira, and regularly apply
    these tools in my day-to-day work. Outside of work, I enjoy building full-stack pet projects from scratch —
    tackling everything from backend logic to responsive UI — as a way to stay sharp and keep learning.
  </p>

  <h2>Education</h2>
  <p>
    I studied at the Software University (SoftUni), where I completed an intensive program in full-stack
    development. The curriculum gave me a solid foundation in software architecture, algorithms, databases, and
    cloud-native development. It also encouraged a hands-on, project-based approach to learning — which remains
    central to how I grow today.
